# Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins 

## Objective 
ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change in Europe. 
My task was to use different supervised algorithms in order to predict if days are pleasant or not, regarding to weather, in several locations all around Europe. 

## Data
The dataset used comes from the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project, which is a collection of data gathered by meteorological stations located all over Europe. 
It can be found at this link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv

## Executing the code
The code is available as a ipynb file in the "scripts" folder.
